# Hydration Error Fix Guide

## Issue
The hydration error was caused by server-side rendering (SSR) generating different HTML than what the client expected. This commonly happens when:

1. Browser-specific code runs during SSR
2. Dynamic data (dates, random numbers) differs between server and client
3. Browser extensions modify the DOM
4. Font variables are inconsistent between server and client

## Solutions Applied

### 1. ClientOnly Component
Created `src/components/client-only.tsx` to ensure certain components only render on the client:

```tsx
'use client';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function ClientOnly({ children, fallback = null }) {
  const [hasMounted, setHasMounted] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setHasMounted(true);
  }, []);

  if (!hasMounted) {
    return <>{fallback}</>;
  }

  return <>{children}</>;
}
```

### 2. Layout Modifications
- Added `suppressHydrationWarning={true}` to the body element
- Moved font variables to the html element for consistency
- Wrapped AuthProvider in ClientOnly component

### 3. AuthProvider Fix
- Changed initial state from `getInitialUser()` to `null`
- Moved localStorage access to useEffect (client-side only)

## Why This Works

1. **Consistent Initial State**: Server always renders with null, client starts with null
2. **Client-Only Rendering**: Components that depend on browser APIs only render after hydration
3. **Suppressed Warnings**: `suppressHydrationWarning` prevents font variable mismatches
4. **Graceful Fallback**: Loading spinner shown until client hydration completes

## Testing
- Visit http://localhost:3001
- Check browser console for hydration errors (should be none)
- Verify all functionality works correctly
- Test shared database functionality

## Production Deployment
This fix is fully compatible with Vercel and maintains all shared database functionality.
