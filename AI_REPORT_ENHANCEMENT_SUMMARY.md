#### 2. Detailed Competency Reporting
- Changed from "{competency} Development" to just "{competency}" with detailed explanations
- Added performance levels (Excellent, Good, Developing, Needs Focus)
- Included average scores and specific development recommendations

#### 3. Comprehensive Summary Section
- **Overall Performance**: Performance distribution and assessment levels
- **Competency Overview**: Individual competency analysis with scores and performance levels
- **Final Assessment**: Detailed suitability determination with specific reasoning

#### 4. **NEW: AI Analysis Regeneration Feature**
- **Force Regeneration**: Admins can now regenerate AI analysis for any submission
- **Updated Models**: Take advantage of improved AI models and analysis techniques
- **Fresh Insights**: Get new perspectives on candidate responses
- **Audit Trail**: Regeneration timestamp tracking

### Files Modified

#### 1. `/src/app/api/background-analysis/route.ts`
**SJT Analysis Enhancements:**
- **Enhanced strengths analysis** with comprehensive individual question breakdown and competency-specific recognition
- **Enhanced weaknesses analysis** with development recommendations and detailed improvement paths
- **Comprehensive summary** with performance distribution and competency overview
- **Added detailed competency-specific analysis** with strength levels (Outstanding/Strong/Developing) and professional assessment language
- **Professional recognition framework** for different performance levels with actionable insights
- **NEW: Regeneration support** with `forceRegenerate` parameter and audit trail tracking

#### 2. `/src/app/admin/report/[id]/page.tsx`
**Admin Interface Enhancements:**
- **Enhanced generation function** to support both initial generation and regeneration
- **NEW: Regeneration UI** with dedicated "Regenerate Analysis" button for completed analyses
- **Smart UI logic** that shows appropriate action based on analysis status

### Report Structure Now Includes:

#### Strengths Section:
1. **Individual Question Analysis - Strong Performances** (with scores and detailed rationale)
2. **Solid Foundational Responses** (for average-performing questions)
3. **Overall Competency Strengths Analysis** (with strength levels: Outstanding/Strong/Developing)
4. **Strength Summary** with recognition and professional asset identification

#### Weaknesses Section:
1. **Individual Question Analysis - Areas for Development**
2. **Overall Competency Development Areas**
3. **Development Recommendations**

#### Summary Section:
1. **Comprehensive Assessment Summary**
2. **Overall Performance** with levels and distribution
3. **Performance Distribution** breakdown
4. **Competency Overview** with individual assessments
5. **Overall Assessment** with suitability determination

### Technical Improvements:
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing system
- Uses existing database structure and APIs
- Follows minimal changes principle - enhanced existing functions rather than creating new ones
- All changes integrate seamlessly with current UI components
- Build verification completed successfully
- **NEW: Regeneration capability** with force regenerate parameter and audit logging

### Benefits:
- Much more detailed and actionable feedback for candidates
- Clear competency-specific analysis
- Professional assessment language
- Structured development recommendations
- Comprehensive performance overview
- Enhanced decision-making support for administrators
- **NEW: Fresh analysis capability** - regenerate with improved AI models and techniques
- **Flexibility for corrections** - easily regenerate if initial analysis needs improvement
- **Quality assurance** - ability to rerun analysis with updated criteria or models

The enhanced system now provides the comprehensive analysis you requested while maintaining full compatibility with the existing framework, plus the added flexibility of AI analysis regeneration for continuous improvement.
