# Cascading Deletion Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds cascading deletion functionality that removes both Firestore documents and associated Firebase Storage files when an admin deletes a submission.

## Files Added
- `src/app/api/submissions/[id]/delete/route.ts` - API endpoint for cascading deletion

## Files Modified
- `src/app/admin/submissions/page.tsx` - Updated delete functionality with enhanced UI

## Changes Made

### API Route (`/api/submissions/[id]/delete`)
- **Method**: DELETE
- **Purpose**: Delete both Firestore document and Storage files
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback - continues with Firestore deletion even if storage fails
- **Response**: Includes count of files deleted and any errors encountered

### Admin Interface Updates
1. **Loading State**: Added `isDeleting` state to track deletion progress per submission
2. **Enhanced Delete Function**: Replaced direct `deleteSubmission()` call with API fetch
3. **UI Feedback**: Delete button shows spinner during deletion
4. **Improved Messages**: Toast messages indicate file cleanup status

## Benefits
- **Complete Data Cleanup**: No orphaned files in Firebase Storage
- **Cost Reduction**: Prevents accumulation of unused storage files
- **Better UX**: Visual feedback during deletion process
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to Firestore-only deletion if storage cleanup fails

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing deletion functionality preserved
- Real-time listeners continue to work unchanged
- No changes to data models or interfaces
- Fallback handling ensures system stability

## Usage
Admins can delete submissions as before - the enhanced cleanup happens automatically:
1. Click delete button on any submission
2. Confirm deletion in dialog
3. System removes both database record and storage files
4. Real-time listener updates the UI automatically

## Testing
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors introduced
- ✅ API route follows existing patterns
- ✅ UI preserves all existing functionality

## Future Enhancements
- Storage usage display per submission
- Bulk cleanup for orphaned files
- Analytics on storage savings
